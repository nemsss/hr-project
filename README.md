# hr-project

A task I've given myself to see how far I've come with the spring framework and maybe angularJS (still deciding how I'll handle the front end).

- First stage is to simulate a typical recruitment process (from job posting, through interviews to employment)
- Then I'll move on to employee management and other features as they come to me
